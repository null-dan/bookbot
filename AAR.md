Intended Outcome:
1. Project was a good chance to learn the process of using git/github, and the commands associated with each.
2. A good chance to validate progress and retained knowledge from python/oop sections

Actual Outcome:
1. Basics usage of Git/Github was fairly easy to understand, though future referral to commands will be necessary until they sink in.

2. The python aspects of the project weren't taken very seriously, they had been prepared early during free time, and since the whole scope wasn't realized until actually tackling the project it wasn't until near completion that the planned method of building the project started to fall apart.
    --* Frustration led to looking up the answer just to finish the project.  

Plan for improvement:
Will need to review more python, solidify foundations and stop looking for one-liners when something more readable will do the job better.
